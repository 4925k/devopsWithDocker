MANDATORY EXERCISE 1.14: ENVIRONMENT
Start both frontend-example and backend-example with correct ports exposed and add ENV to Dockerfile with necessary information from both READMEs (front, back).

Ignore the backend configurations until frontend sends requests to _backend_url_/ping when you press the button.

You know that the configuration is ready when the button for 1.14 of frontend-example responds and turns green.

Do not alter the code of either project

Submit the edited Dockerfiles and commands used to run.

Backend and Frontend

The frontend will first talk to your browser. Then the code will be executed from your browser and that will send a message to backend.

More information about connection between frontend and backend

TIP: When configuring web applications keep browser developer console ALWAYS open, F12 or cmd+shift+I when the browser window is open. Information about configuring cross origin requests is in README of the backend project.

TIP: Developer console has multiple views, most important ones are Console and Network. Exploring the Network tab can give you a lot of information on where messages are being sent and what is received as response!
