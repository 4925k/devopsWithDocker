EXERCISE 1.5: SIZES OF IMAGES
In the Exercise 1.3 we used devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu.

Here is the same application but instead of Ubuntu is using Alpine Linux: devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine.

Pull both images and compare the image sizes. Go inside the alpine container and make sure the secret message functionality is the same. Alpine version doesn't have bash but it has sh.

EXERCISE 1.3: SECRET MESSAGE
Now that we've warmed up it's time to get inside a container while it's running!

Image devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu will start a container that outputs logs into a file. 
Go inside the container and use tail -f ./text.log to follow the logs. Every 10 seconds the clock will send you a "secret message".

Submit the secret message and command(s) given as your answer.
