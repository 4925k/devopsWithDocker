Containers are instances of images.

The Image provides all the necessary instructions and dependencies 
for the container to run.

Dockerfile is an instructional file to create an image.

A Volume is simply a folder (or a file) that is shared between the host machine and 
the container. If a file in volume is modified by a program that's running 
inside the container the changes are also saved from destruction when 
the container is shut down as the file exists on the host machine.
This is the main use for volumes as otherwise all of the files wouldn't 
be accessible when restarting the container. Volumes also can be used to 
share files between containers and run programs that are able to load 
changed files.
