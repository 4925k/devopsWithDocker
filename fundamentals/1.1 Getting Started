EXERCISE 1.1: GETTING STARTED
Since we already did "Hello, World!" in the material let's do something else.

Start 3 containers from an image that does not automatically exit (such as nginx) in detached mode.

Stop two of the containers and leave one container running.

Submit the output for docker ps -a which shows 2 stopped containers and one running.
