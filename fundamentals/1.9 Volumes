EXERCISE 1.9: VOLUMES
In this exercise we won't create a new Dockerfile.

Image devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service creates a timestamp every two seconds to /usr/src/app/text.log when it's not given a command. Start the container with bind mount so that the logs are created into your filesystem.

Submit the command you used to complete the exercise.

Hint: read the note that was made just before this exercise!
